    <name>Fredrik Frodlund</name>
    <bio>Fredrik has been building interfaces for the web since 1996. His specialties lies in building pattern libraries, UI components and web interfaces using HTML and CSS (and occasionally some presentational JavaScript).

In his role as a front end designer, he can be regarded as the mortar for the proverbial bricks that are developers and designers. He is well accustomed to working very closely with UX and developers alike. He sees it as an important way of working in order to quickly and efficiently transform and validate concepts, ideas and designs into the web medium.

He is very passionate about quality, accessibility and usability. Aesthetic beauty is of course important, but for Fredrik, it is also important to build interfaces that work for as many users as possible, no matter what platform they use or what disabilities, if any, they may have.</bio>
